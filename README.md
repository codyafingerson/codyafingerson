I'm Cody, a senior Computer Science student at Montana State University and a backend enthusiast. I enjoy building clean, reliable software with a focus on creating maintainable and efficient systems. My experience includes developing internal tools for laser calibration, creating a toy programming language called Cosmo, and working with technologies like TypeScript, C#, Node.js, and Spring Boot.

I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges in the tech world! If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to connect with you!
