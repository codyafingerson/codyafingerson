I'm a senior Computer Science student with a unique background in healthcare, where I worked as a Pharmacy Technician. This experience, coupled with my lifelong interest in technology, led me to pursue a career in the tech industry.

I specialize in backend development but am also proficient in frontend technologies. My programming language toolkit includes **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Java**, **C**, **C#**, **Bash**, **MySQL**, **SQLite**, and **MongoDB**.

In terms of tools and frameworks, I'm experienced with **Git/GitHub**, **TailwindCSS**, **LucidChart**, **Node.js**, **React**, **Vue.js**, **WPF**, **Redux/Redux Toolkit**, **Express.js**, **Figma**, and **Java Spring Boot**.

I've had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects during my academic journey. These include developing a coding language called **CatScript** for my university, creating an internal calibration utility for a quantum cascade laser driver using **C# and WPF**, and building a support ticket submission application using **React and Express.js**.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a deep love for coding and often engage in it as a hobby. What I find most fascinating about Computer Science is its ability to solve real-world problems and its constant evolution. I'm particularly interested in application architecture, always looking for the most efficient and effective ways to structure applications.

I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges in the tech world! If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to connect with you!
